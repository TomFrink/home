We are a community of professionals in disciplines related to software development in the Greater Rochester Area. We are Software and Quality Assurance Engineers, Product Managers and Entrepreneurs, and Students and Teachers looking to share our experiences and knowledge with one another in an effort to support and grow the community as a whole.

This site is hosted on DigitalOcean. If you're looking for an inexpensive and straightforward cloud provider, consider signing up via https://m.do.co/c/cff11ae2eb14.

We also accept support via Patreon. All proceeds go directly back into supporting the organization and tech education.
