As the Greater Rochester Areaâ€™s leading community of tech professionals, we aim to share our experiences and knowledge with one another in an effort to support and grow  as a whole. In disciplines related to Software & Development such as Software Engineering, Product Management, and Quality Assurance; our hope is to promote the quality and profile of the Rochester Tech scene. Our members are made up of Contributors, Managers, Entrepreneurs, Students, and Teachers; all with a passion for better code.

Coordinating events, moderating slack, and operating our platforms takes time and money. Please, consider supporting us through this Patreon.
